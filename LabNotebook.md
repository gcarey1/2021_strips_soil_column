# Notebook for the prairie strips soil column project

## 20210602

For the first watering, we applied 1.5 L to 35 cm columns and 3 L to 65 cm columns

## 20210607

Rainfall number 2 on block 1. Water much clearer

* We applied 1 L of DI water to each column
* We collected ~ 750 mL of water from each column

Before each rainfall, we trim vegetation to be flush with the top of the column

## 20210623

Rainfall number 4 on block 2. As noted, we have ponding on several of the short columns. These columns generally took the longest to drain. 

*Today the filtering is taking longer, on the order of what we observed after the initial watering*

#NOTE on B2R4: Leachate samples from C27-C36 and Cx3 + Cx4 were frozen overnight. Jared advised Erik to put the water samples in the cooler, but had indicated a freezer by mistake.
