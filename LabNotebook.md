## 20210602

For the first watering, we applied 1.5 L to 35 cm columns and 3 L to 65 cm columns

## 20210607

Rainfall number 2 on block 1. Water much clearer

* We applied 1 L of DI water to each column
* We collected ~ 750 mL of water from each column

Before each rainfall, we trim vegetation to be flush with the top of the column
